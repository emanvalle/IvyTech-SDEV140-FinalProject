# Marty's Music

## Objective
The objective of the final project for IvyTech's SDEV140 course is to develop a GUI application using Python tkinter.

## Purpose
  The purpose of this GUI is to develop a user interface learn about a musician. The user can browse to see different sections to learn more about a musician, such as an about section, songs with cover art, and future events. There will also be a way to contact the music with links to social media or a form that can be filled out and submitted.
 
## Reason for Creation
  One of my best friends is a very passionate musician who makes good music and is very involved in the music community. There is no structured format for other to learn more about him, his music, and any future planned events. This GUI will provide an example to follow for future musicals wanting a similar interface for users to learn more about them.

## Project Goals
  The primary goal for this application is to provide information for a user to learn about a musician. This information will be included in sections for:
- About
- Songs
- Events
- Contacting the musician

## Target Audience
  The audience is anyone who is interested in learning more about a certain musician. This audience age varies from teenagers to elderly making it a point to make the interface simple to use and understand. As passionate music enthusiasts, the audience will not only want to learn about the artist but also about the music the artist is producing, future events the musician will be involved in, and how to contact this musician for inquiries.
